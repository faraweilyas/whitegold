<strong>whiteGold</strong> is a PHP light web application framework with sophisticated syntax and this is inspired by the <strong>[Laravel Framework](https://laravel.com)</strong> with the aim to ease the way components are being installed alongside our project which disrupts scaling and development process. <strong>whiteGold</strong> attempts to tackle this by tearing down components to make them stand alone so it's easy to remove, add and update different components at any point in time.

## Installation

You can get a fresh installation With [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), all you have to do is create a new project from [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/faraweilyas/whitegold):

```sh
$ composer create-project faraweilyas/whitegold project-folder
$ cd project-folder
